        <p>t Bursted Wood Primary School, children in key stage 1 had already embarked on a secure mathematical 
            journey, putting algebra at the heart of the curriculum. The demands of the 2014 National Curriculum meant that in Year 1 
            children were expected to be taught to use all four arithmetic operations, and fractions, as operators. As a result, Bursted Wood 
            adopted a series of textbooks written by Caleb Gattegno called <em>Numbers in Colours.</em> These textbooks use Cuisenaire rods to 
            encourage the learner to explore patterns, and then to give letter code names to the patterns, and record the relationships 
            between them with equations. It is only after the letter code exploration that they finally use a rod as a unit of measure (e.g. 
            white representing one), and transform their equations into arithmetic. Very early on in Year 1, children are able to read 
            and write a variety of complex algebraic

             impressive throughout key stage 1. In Year 2 we wanted to take it a step further by running computing lessons using the 
             same use of natural language and level of sophistication.

      <h3>Why Haskell?</h3>
      <p>
      Haskell is closely aligned to conceptual mathematics and number theory, the inspiration for Gattegno Mathematics. It has 
      four attributes that make it particularly appropriate for mathematics education:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Its syntax is very close to traditional mathematical notation (but beware that it can be too terse).
        </li>
        <li>
        Variables are statically typed, which means that programmers are protected by the compiler from passing invalid 
        information as an argument (input) or output value.
        </li>
        <li>
        The Haskell interpreter evaluates functions ‘lazily’, only when required. This makes  it possible to program infinite data 
        structures in finite memory.
        </li>
        <li>
        nformation is passed from the arguments to functions by pattern matching. This  is an intuitive way for programmers to 
        envisage and reason about the behaviour of their programs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Starting with a staircase</h3>
      <p>
      To start, we went back to a familiar pattern called a staircase. This is built from one rod
      of each colour arranged in size order (figure  1). The children were able to physically build 
      the staircase. However, because they were so familiar with the pattern, they could also 
      access it virtually, which would help with debugging and logical reasoning later. 
      A role-play game to establish computational thinking was introduced 
      before any actual programming began. This allowed the children to familiarise themselves 
      with the function calls <em>successor</em> and <em>predecessor (succ, pred)</em> while traversing 
      the staircase. The children would take turns to ask each other questions such as <em>succ 
      White</em> (answer Red) or <em>pred Orange</em>(answer Blue). To help the children access 
      the new programming vocabulary, one child</p>

        would take the role of the ‘engine’ and the other ‘interpreter’. This was extended to 
        succ $ succ (successor of successor) which uses function composition $. Some children could creatively enjoy inventing 
        functions such as succ $ succ $ succ White to test the technique. The children experimented by writing down their calls 
        before building themselves a rod calculator in Haskell. The language soon became a natural part of lessons and meant that it was easy to 
        progress to the next step.

       run, and that this would require carefully debugging and retyping. The children could spot bugs in the engine because they 
       had already worked out the answer. The staircase was a familiar pattern, so they could predict what the output should be. 
       Children were also able to edit the Colour data type to model odd or even staircases and test their functions to see 
       what the effect would be on the derived successor function. A transcript (see insert) shows a pupil working with the

          Very soon the children were able to construct their own rod calculator in Haskell, by first constructing the engine 
          using the Colour data type. Then the children asked the same role-play questions, this time by typing the language 
          into the interpreter window. It soon became apparent that errors in the engine meant that the interpreter would not

        that the version of the succ function that works for a staircase with a step size White is distinct from the version of 
        succ in an even staircase, and he corrects himself. It is clear to see that he has constructed an image of the staircase and

        <h3>Calculating</h3>
        <p>
          To build the rod arithmetic calculator, the pupil reuses the equations that they studied in Year 1. Gattegno’s definitions 
          lie in the algebraic domain. Programming illustrates the distinction between algebra and arithmetic. Making this clear is crucial 
          to investigating the level of abstraction that the learner has reached. The figure shows a rod arithmetic calculator 
          constructed after four terms of Gattegno Mathematics. The values associated with the rod code letters are modelled 
          as constant functions in Haskell. Nine equations are derived from Gattegno’s 
          equivalent expressions. The tenth, which binds an integer value to the code for 
          White, shows the choice of measuring unit, which fixes the values of the 
          other codes.<br>
          By introducing Haskell to the children we have been able to take the mathematics that the children are 
          familiar with and successfully and creatively introduce programming functions. We have been able to provide 
          both the teacher and child with a rich situation, allowing them to think both 
          mathematically and computationally. It is exciting to think where our investigations may lead us to next!
