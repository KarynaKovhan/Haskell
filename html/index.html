        <p>At Bursted Wood Primary School, 
          children in key stage 1 had already 
          embarked on a secure mathematical 
          journey, putting algebra at the heart of 
          the curriculum. The demands of the 2014 
          National Curriculum meant that in Year 1 
          children were expected to be taught to use 
          all four arithmetic operations, and fractions, 
          as operators. As a result, Bursted Wood 
          adopted a series of textbooks written by 
          Caleb Gattegno called <em>Numbers in Colours.</em> 
          These textbooks use Cuisenaire rods to 
          encourage the learner to explore patterns, 
          and then to give letter code names to the 
          patterns, and record the relationships 
          between them with equations. It is only 
          after the letter code exploration that they 
          finally use a rod as a unit of measure (e.g. 
          white representing one), and transform 
          their equations into arithmetic. Very early 
          on in Year 1, children are able to read 
          and write a variety of complex algebraic</p>

          <p>equations using plus, minus, multiply, 
            and fractions as operators, and translate 
            these into arithmetic. The results had been 
            impressive throughout key stage 1. In 
            Year 2 we wanted to take it a step further 
            by running computing lessons using the 
            same use of natural language and level 
            of sophistication.
            <h3>Why Haskell?</h3>
            Haskell is closely aligned to conceptual 
            mathematics and number theory, the 
            inspiration for Gattegno Mathematics. It has 
            four attributes that make it particularly 
            appropriate for mathematics education:
            <ul>
              <li>Its syntax is very close to traditional 
                mathematical notation (but beware 
                that it can be too terse).</li>
              <li>Variables are statically typed, which 
                means that programmers are protected 
                by the compiler from passing invalid 
                information as an argument (input) or 
                output value.</li>
              <li>The Haskell interpreter evaluates functions 
                ‘lazily’, only when required. This makes 
                it possible to program infinite data 
                structures in finite memory.</li>
              <li>Information is passed from the arguments 
                to functions by pattern matching. This 
                is an intuitive way for programmers to 
                envisage and reason about the behaviour 
                of their programs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><h3>Starting with a staircase</h3>
            To start, we went back to a familiar pattern 
            that Gattegno introduces in the textbooks, 
            called a staircase. This is built from one rod 
            of each colour arranged in size order (figure 
            1). The children were able to physically build 
            the staircase. However, because they were 
            so familiar with the pattern, they could also 
            access it virtually, which would help with 
            debugging and logical reasoning later. 
            A role-play game to establish 
            computational thinking was introduced 
            before any actual programming began. This 
            allowed the children to familiarise themselves 
            with the function calls <em>successor</em> and 
            <em>predecessor (succ, pred)</em> while traversing 
            the staircase. The children would take turns 
            to ask each other questions such as <em>succ 
            White</em> (answer Red) or <em>pred Orange</em>
            (answer Blue). To help the children access 
            the new programming vocabulary, one child</p>
